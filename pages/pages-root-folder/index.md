# Welcome to the IOL

The International Linguistics Olympiad (IOL) is an annual international competition that brings together secondary school students and experts from various fields of linguistics. Since its inception in 2003, the IOL has been hosted in a different country each summer. The competition challenges participants to analyze the grammar, structure, culture, and history of different languages and to demonstrate their linguistic abilities through puzzles and problem-solving challenges.

The IOL encourages creativity and imagination and helps participants develop skills in language analysis and problem-solving. By promoting awareness and understanding of diverse cultures and histories, the competition plays a vital role in nurturing future linguistics experts and contributing to the development of this academic field. No prior knowledge of linguistics or languages is required, as even the most challenging problems only require logical ability, patient work, and a willingness to think outside the box.

Why not give some of our [past problems](/problems/by_year/) a try and see if you have what it takes to compete in the world's toughest puzzles in language and linguistics?

<!-- ## Announcement (April 2nd, 2021)
From the Local Organizing Committee of the 18th IOL

Due to these unpredictable times and taking into account safety measures applied in Latvia, IOL 2021 will be held remotely, with no teams able to attend in person.
The exact amount of participation fees and registration deadlines will be determined in a week or two.

We thank you for the patience and look forward to having you online with us on July 19-23, when one of the most exciting events of the summer will take place! Opening and closing ceremonies will be streamed online, but for the individual and team competitions, teams must meet in a single location and will be invigilated by a person appointed by the Jury.
